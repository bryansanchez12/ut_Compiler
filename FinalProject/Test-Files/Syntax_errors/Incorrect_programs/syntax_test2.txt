      Example_Test 2 : Syntax Errors
      This tests is has one mistake. We are declaring a class with three variables inside and
      an if statement. The mistake is in the comment. It has only one '-' instead of '--'

*--

class Main(){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";
    boolean b1 = False;

    if (var1 == 5){
        -- Many things can go inside an if condition
    };

};
