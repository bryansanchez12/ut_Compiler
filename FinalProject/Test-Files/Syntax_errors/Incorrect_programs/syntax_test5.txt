      Example_Test 5 : Syntax Errors
      This tests is has one mistake. We are declaring a class with three variables inside and
      a while condition. The mistake is using '=' instead of '==' in the while condition clause

*--

class Main(){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";
    boolean b1 = False;

    while (var1 = 5){
        b1 = True;
    };

};
