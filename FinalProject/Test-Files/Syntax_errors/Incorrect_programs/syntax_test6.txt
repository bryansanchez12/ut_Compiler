      Example_Test 6 : Syntax Errors
      This tests is has one mistake. We are declaring a class with three variables inside and
      a for-loop. The mistake is in the for-loop declaration. ';' is needed and ',' was used.

class Main(){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";
    boolean b1 = False;

    for (int i = 0; i < var1, i = i + 1){
        var1 = var1 + 1;
    };

};
