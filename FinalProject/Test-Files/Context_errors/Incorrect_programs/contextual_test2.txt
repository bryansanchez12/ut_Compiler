      Example_Test 2 : Semantic Errors
      This tests is incorrect. We are declaring a class with three variables inside and
      an if statement. However, the variable in the if statement var2, has not been declared before.

class Main(){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";
    boolean b1 = False;

    if (var2 == 5){
        -- Many things can go inside an if condition
    };

};
