      Example_Test 1 : Semantic Errors
      This tests is incorrect. We are declaring a class with three variables inside.
      The mistake is that b1 is missing boolean keyword, and because it has not been declared before,
      an error appears.

class Main(int term1, int term2){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";
    b1 = False;

};
