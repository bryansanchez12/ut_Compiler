      Example_Test 3 : Semantic Errors
      This tests is incorrect. We are declaring a class and some variables, with an if condition.
      However, the last declaration is happening with variables of the wrong scope level.

class Main1(){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";

    if (True){
        boolean b1 = False;
    }

    b1 = True;

};
