      Example_Test 4 : Semantic Errors
      This tests is incorrect. We are declaring a function inside a class.
      However, we are trying to perform / operations on a string.

*--

class Main(){

    int var1 = 5;
    string str1 = "test";
    boolean b1 = False;

    def myfunction(int var2){
        str2 = str1 / str1;
    };

};
